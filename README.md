# Docker Microservices
The primary objective of this repository is to showcase my aptitude in crafting language-specific Docker images and containers. This repository comprises three distinct docker setups. These setups are for Python, JavaScript, and PHP. 

These setups were created as part of the "Docker & Kubernetes: The Practical Guide" course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, which is available on Udemy.

I undertook this course to help prepare me for the DCA and CKAD examinations, which I will be taking early September 2023.
