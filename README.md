# Docker Microservices

The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to create language-specific Docker images and containers.  

It contains three distinct Docker setups for Python, JavaScript, and PHP.

These setups were developed as part of the "Docker & Kubernetes: The Practical Guide" course taught by Maximilian Schwarzmüller, available on Udemy.

I pursued this course to better prepare for the DCA and CKAD exams scheduled for early September 2023.
